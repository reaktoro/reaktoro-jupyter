    "## Specifying different phases and corresponding models\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifying the phases and their species is not enough to fully describe a chemical system in the *computational\n",
    "sense*. Every phase in Reaktoro has two associated models: a *thermodynamic model* and a *chemical model*. These\n",
    "denominations are not standard in the literature, but they are useful in the differentiation of two needed types\n",
    "of models for a phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A *thermodynamic model* is a model for the calculation of *standard thermodynamic properties* of the species.\n",
    "Examples include standard Gibbs energies, or standard chemical potentials, standard molar volumes, standard heat\n",
    "capacities, standard enthalpies, and so forth. These models are functions of *temperature* and *pressure* only.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A *chemical model* is a model that describes the *non-ideal behavior* of phases. These models not only depend on\n",
    "temperature and pressure, like the thermodynamic models, but also on the amounts of the species in the phase. To be\n",
    "more precise, on the concentrations of these species, which can be calculated from the amounts of the species.\n",
    "\n",
    "One can define a chemical system with many phases, each phase containing one or more species. This does not mean\n",
    "that all phases and their species exist at positive amounts! To be precise, this means that the chemical\n",
    "calculations, equilibrium or kinetics, are capable of deciding if a phase in the chemical system should exist at\n",
    "positive amounts for some given conditions (e.g., temperature, pressure, overall composition).\n",
    "\n",
    "By selecting as many phases as possible, with the possibilities constrained by the *thermodynamic database* being\n",
    "used, one can increase the confidence level of the estimated chemical states. Note, however, that accurate and\n",
    "realistic estimates depend on many more factors than just the selection of potential phases, such as the *choice of\n",
    "thermodynamic models for non-ideal phases*. Furthermore, note that adding too many phases and species to the\n",
    "definition of the chemical system can result in *more computationally expensive* chemical calculations. In critical\n",
    "performance applications, for instance, when combining chemical reactions and fluid flow and species transport\n",
    "modeling, restricting the number of phases and species might be necessary for achieving feasible simulation times.\n",
    "The modeler is responsible to decide to which extent the number of phases and species can be compromised for\n",
    "efficiency reasons at the expense of chemical realism."
