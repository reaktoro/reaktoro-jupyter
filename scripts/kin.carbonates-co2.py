# # Dissolution of carbonate minerals in a CO<sub>2</sub>-saturated brine
#
# In this tutorial, we demonstrate how Reaktoro can be used to kinetically model the dissolution of carbonate
# minerals (calcite, magnesite, and dolomite) in a CO<sub>2</sub>-saturated brine.
#
# ### Defining the chemical system
#
# We start with importing the **reaktoro** Python package to enable us to use all its library components (classes,
# methods, constants).

from reaktoro import *

# In this simulation, we consider an *aqueous phase* (to model the brine solution), a *gaseous phase* (to model the
# CO<sub>2</sub>-rich phase with water vapor), and four pure *mineral phases*: halite, calcite, magnesite,
# and dolomite. These are the phases that will either exist initially during the simulation, or that could
# potentially appear later as the calculations proceed.
#
# All potential phases that could appear in a reactive process should ideally be considered when defining the
# chemical system. If one or more of these phases are ignored, then the equilibrium and kinetics calculations cannot
# identify if they should be present or not with positive amounts. Unrealistic results may occur, such as,
# for example, an aqueous phase containing more CO<sub>2</sub> dissolved than it could, because a gaseous phase,
# which should contain the excess of CO<sub>2</sub>, was not considered in the chemical system.
#
# The code below uses class [ChemicalEditor](https://reaktoro.org/cpp/classReaktoro_1_1ChemicalEditor.html) to define
# our chemical system with the phases of interest and their species:

editor = ChemicalEditor()
editor.addAqueousPhaseWithElementsOf("H2O NaCl CaCO3 MgCO3")
editor.addGaseousPhase(["H2O(g)", "CO2(g)"])
editor.addMineralPhase("Calcite")
editor.addMineralPhase("Magnesite")
editor.addMineralPhase("Dolomite")
editor.addMineralPhase("Halite")

# The aqueous phase is defined by considering all aqueous species in the database that could form once the substances
# H<sub>2</sub>O, NaCl, CaCO<sub>3</sub>, and MgCO<sub>3</sub> are mixed. The gaseous phase is defined
# so that only the gaseous species H<sub>2</sub>O(g) and CO<sub>2</sub>(g) are considered. There are four pure
# mineral phases: calcite (CaCO<sub>3</sub>), magnesite (MgCO<sub>3</sub>), dolomite (CaMg(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>),
# and halite (NaCl).
#
# ### Defining the kinetically-controlled reactions
#
# A *partial equilibrium assumption* is considered in this simulation. This simplifies the problem by assuming that
# those species that react at much faster rates do so *continually in chemical equilibrium*. They are referred to as
# *equilibrium species*. The remaining species (those reacting at relatively slower rates) are referred to as
# *kinetic species*.
#
# Because aqueous and gaseous species, as well as halite, react at relatively fast rates, they are reasonable
# candidates in this problem for being equilibrium species. The kinetic species are thus the carbonate minerals:
# calcite, magnesite, and dolomite.
#
# With this partial equilibrium assumption, there is no need to specify kinetic rate laws for the fast-reacting
# equilibrium species. For these species, chemical equilibrium calculations are performed to update their amounts as the
# amounts of each kinetic species change over time (i.e., the equilibrium species react instantaneously to a new
# state of equilibrium as the kinetic species react and perturb the current partial equilibrium state).
#
# Thus, we only need to define kinetic rates for the relatively slow-reacting carbonate minerals (our kinetic species
# in this simulation), which is shown below

# We set the equation of each mineral reaction using method
# [MineralReaction::setEquation](https://reaktoro.org/cpp/classReaktoro_1_1MineralReaction.html#a6edcfede18eff82f74a7bd8a56f1bea8).
#
# It follows by prescribtion of neutral and acidic mechanisms for each mineral reaction using the method
# [MineralReaction::addMechanism](https://reaktoro.org/cpp/classReaktoro_1_1MineralReaction.html#a1bdeff51e51f42e4635208241cd54027)
# In particular, we set values for `logk`, the kinetic rate constant of the reaction in log scale, and `Ea`,
# the Arrhenius activation energy. The units of both parameters must be provided as shown in the example,
# and other compatible units are allowed.
#
# Finally, we define the specific surface area of the mineral using the method
# [MineralReaction::setSpecificSurfaceArea](https://reaktoro.org/cpp/classReaktoro_1_1MineralReaction.html#a9ea2feb68af0beddc856d6a60b863181).
# Any units compatible to m<sup>2</sup>/kg or m<sup>2</sup>/m<sup>3</sup> are allowed (e.g., cm<sup>2</sup>/g,
# mm<sup>2</sup>/mm<sup>3</sup>).
#
# ### Creating the chemical and reaction systems
#
# Create instances of
# [ChemicalSystem](https://reaktoro.org/cpp/classReaktoro_1_1ChemicalSystem.html) and
# [ReactionSystem](https://reaktoro.org/cpp/classReaktoro_1_1ReactionSystem.html).

system = ChemicalSystem(editor)
reactions = ReactionSystem(editor)

# Class [ChemicalSystem](https://reaktoro.org/cpp/classReaktoro_1_1ChemicalSystem.html) is used to represent a
# chemical system, containing one or more phases  (in this problem, aqueous, gaseous, and mineral phases). Each
# phase can contain one or more species (the aqueous phase includes many aqueous species, the gaseous phase two,
# and each mineral phase containing a single mineral species with the same name as the name of the phase). This class
# is also used to calculate the thermodynamic properties of the phases and species (standard thermodynamic properties,
# activities, chemical potentials, phase molar volume, etc.).
#
# Class [ReactionSystem](https://reaktoro.org/cpp/classReaktoro_1_1ReactionSystem.html) is a collection of
# [Reaction](https://reaktoro.org/cpp/classReaktoro_1_1Reaction.html) objects used to represent a system of chemical
# reactions that are controlled by chemical kinetics. These classes provide convenient methods for the calculation of
# equilibrium constants, reaction quotients, and rates of the reactions.
#
# ### Specifying equilibrium and kinetic species
#
# In Reaktoro, the species in a chemical system can be partitioned into groups of:
# *equilibrium species*, *kinetic species*, and *inert species*.
# For the *equilibrium species*, their amounts are governed by chemical equilibrium (calculated via a Gibbs energy
# minimization). The amount of *kinetic species* are controlled by chemical kinetics (by solving a system of ordinary
# differential equations that models the kinetics of a system of reactions). The *inert species* maintain their
# amounts constant in all chemical equilibrium or kinetics calculations.
#
# This classification of species can be done using class
# [Partition](https://reaktoro.org/cpp/classReaktoro_1_1Partition.html). By default, all species are considered to
# be equilibrium species in this class. Thus, we only need to specify which are kinetic ones:

partition = Partition(system)
partition.setKineticSpecies(["Calcite", "Magnesite", "Dolomite"])

# In this case, the mineral species calcite, magnesite, and dolomite are specified to be *kinetic species* using
# method [Partition::setKineticSpecies](https://reaktoro.org/cpp/classReaktoro_1_1Partition.html#a9691b3689b8a09280595f2b898cc5e3e).
# Method [Partition::setKineticPhases](
# https://reaktoro.org/cpp/classReaktoro_1_1Partition.html#a235c673476b0d6682148b70b04024499) could also
# be used here. It sets all species in the given phases to be kinetic species, and it is more convenient if
# a phase has many species. However, since each of the mineral phases considered here only contains a single mineral
# species, the method [Partition::setKineticSpecies](https://reaktoro.org/cpp/classReaktoro_1_1Partition.html#a9691b3689b8a09280595f2b898cc5e3e)
# is a convenient alternative.
#
# ### Defining the initial state of the equilibrium species
#
# In a chemical kinetics calculation, an *initial condition* is needed for the amounts of both equilibrium and
# kinetic species.
#
# The equilibrium problem formulated below, using class
# [EquilibriumProblem](https://reaktoro.org/cpp/classReaktoro_1_1EquilibriumProblem.html), is done so that the
# initial condition for the amounts of each equilibrium species result from the solution of a chemical equilibrium
# problem in which 1 kg of water is mixed with 1 mol of NaCl and 1 mol of CO<sub>2</sub> at 60 &deg;C
# and 100 bar. This amount of CO<sub>2</sub> is sufficient to saturate the brine solution. The excess will exist in
# the CO<sub>2</sub>-rich gaseous phase.

problem = EquilibriumProblem(system)
problem.setPartition(partition)
problem.setTemperature(60, "celsius")
problem.setPressure(100, "bar")
problem.add("H2O", 1, "kg")
problem.add("NaCl", 1, "mol")
problem.add("CO2", 1, "mol")

# > **Note:** To ensure that the equilibrium calculation performed in the next step ignores the kinetic species in the
# > system so that we maintain a disequilibrium state between equilibrium and kinetic species, **it is important!** not to
# > forget to call
# > [EquilibriumProblem::setPartition](https://reaktoro.org/cpp/classReaktoro_1_1EquilibriumProblem.html#a53a9496c9d4ffc72a85903146b390e44)
# > method. Ignoring this step will produce an initial condition for the amounts of equilibrium and kinetic species
# > that correspond to a complete equilibrium state in the system so that no kinetics calculation makes sense afterwards.
#
# ### Calculating the initial amounts of the equilibrium species
#
# We now use the convenient [equilibrate](https://reaktoro.org/cpp/namespaceReaktoro.html#af2d3b39d3e0b8f9cb5a4d9bbb06b697e)
# function to calculate the amounts of the equilibrium species by minimizing
# the Gibbs energy of the equilibrium partition only, and not of the entire system. The result is stored in the
# object `state0` of class [ChemicalState](https://reaktoro.org/cpp/classReaktoro_1_1ChemicalState.html),
# a computational representation of the state of a multiphase chemical system defined by its temperature (*T*),
# pressure (*P*), and vector of species amounts (*n*). We then output this chemical state to a file.
#
# We have now to prescribe the initial amounts of the kinetic species (i.e., the carbonate minerals). This is done
# below by setting the initial mass of calcite to 100 g and of dolomite to 50 g. The initial amount of magnesite is
# zero.

# +
state0 = equilibrate(problem)
state0.output('demo-kineticpath-carbonates-co2-before-kinetics.txt')

state0.setSpeciesMass("Calcite", 100, "g")
state0.setSpeciesMass("Dolomite", 50, "g")
# -

# ### Setting the kinetic path calculations
#
# To be able to simulate the kinetic process of mineral dissolution/precipitation, we introduce the
# instance of the class [KineticPath](https://reaktoro.org/cpp/classReaktoro_1_1KineticPath.html) that enables this
# functionality. The instance of kinetic path solver is provided with the partition to the equilibrium, kinetic,
# and inert species defined above.

path = KineticPath(reactions)
path.setPartition(partition)

# > **Note**: For repeated chemical kinetics calculations (e.g., in a reactive transport simulation, where kinetics is
# performed for each mesh cell/node), consider using the class
# [KineticSolver](https://reaktoro.org/cpp/classReaktoro_1_1KineticSolver.html) instead for avoiding some overhead of
# class [KineticPath](https://reaktoro.org/cpp/classReaktoro_1_1KineticPath.html). For equilibrium calculations,
# consider also the class [EquilibriumSolver](https://reaktoro.org/cpp/classReaktoro_1_1EquilibriumSolver.html),
# instead of method [equilibrate](https://reaktoro.org/cpp/namespaceReaktoro.html#af2d3b39d3e0b8f9cb5a4d9bbb06b697e),
# for similar reasons.
#
# To analyze the result of kinetic simulations, we save the evolution of different properties of the chemical system
# into file `result.txt`.

output = path.output()
output.filename("results.txt")
output.add("time(units=minute)")
output.add("pH")
output.add("speciesMolality(Ca++ units=mmolal)", "Ca++ [mmolal]")
output.add("speciesMolality(Mg++ units=mmolal)", "Mg++ [mmolal]")
output.add("phaseMass(Calcite units=g)", "Calcite [units=g]")
output.add("phaseMass(Dolomite units=g)", "Dolomite [units=g]")

# > **Note**: A list of all possible quantities that can be plotted is shown in the class
# [ChemicalQuantity](https://reaktoro.org/cpp/classReaktoro_1_1ChemicalQuantity.html), which provides an interface
# for convenient ways of their retrieval.
#
# To perform the calculation of the kinetic path, we need to provide time interval, on which this path must be
# recovered. In this case, we choose 25 hours of simulations. The initial chemical state provided by the instance
# `state0`, as well as the time interval with units, in which time is measured, are given with a call of the function
# `solve`.

t0, t1 = 0.0, 25.0
path.solve(state0, t0, t1, "hours")

# ### Plotting the results of equilibrium path calculation
#
# To load results from the outputfile, we use [loadtxt](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.loadtxt.html)
# function provided by the *numpy* package:

filearray = numpy.loadtxt("results.txt", skiprows=1) # load data from the file skipping the one row
data = filearray.T  # transpose the matrix with data
[time_indx, ph_indx, ca_indx, mg_indx, calcite_indx, dolomite_indx] \
    = numpy.arange(0, 6) # assign indices of the corresponding data

# To visually analyze the obtained reaction path, we export
# [bokeh](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/gallery.html#standalone-examples) python plotting package.

from bokeh.plotting import figure, show
from bokeh.io import output_notebook
output_notebook()

# We define a custom function that would generate figure of certain size (in this case, 600 by 300) with label `time`
# on the x-axis:

def custom_figure(title, y_axis_label):
    return figure(plot_width=600, plot_height=300,
                  title=title,
                  x_axis_label='time',
                  y_axis_label=y_axis_label)


# The plots below depict different chemical properties (x-axis) with respect to the time interval of the kinetic
# simulation (y-axis).
# In the first plot, we see the growth in the molality of Ca element. At the same time, the molality of Mg is first
# increasing and later decreasing. This coincides with the behavior of the mass of minerals on the plots below.

time = data[time_indx, :]  # fetch time from the data matrix
fig1 = custom_figure(title="Ca++ and Mg++ molality w.r.t. time", y_axis_label="Amount of Ca++ and Mg++ [mmolal]")
fig1.line(time, data[ca_indx], line_width=4, legend_label="Ca++", color="orange")
fig1.line(time, data[mg_indx], line_width=4, legend_label="Mg++", color="green")
show(fig1)

# We see the dissolution of the calcite along the time, which is aligned with the earlier plot, where the amount of Ca
# element monotonically grows (getting released).

fig2 = custom_figure(title="Calcite dissolution w.r.t. time", y_axis_label="Mass of Calcite [g]")
fig2.line(time, data[calcite_indx], line_width=4, legend_label="Calcite")
show(fig2)

# Similar correspondence can be seen from the dolomite plot with respect to time. We see below that amount of
# dolomite first decreases and then grows due to the initial dissolution and later precipitation of it in the
# chemical system.

fig3 = custom_figure(title="Dolomite behaviour w.r.t. time", y_axis_label="Mass of Dolomite [g]")
fig3.line(time, data[dolomite_indx], line_width=4, legend_label="Dolomite", color="coral")
show(fig3)

# As this happens, the chemical system becomes less acidic with pH growing with time:

fig4 = custom_figure(title="pH behaviour w.r.t. time", y_axis_label="pH [-]")
fig4.line(time, data[ph_indx], line_width=4, color="darkviolet")
show(fig4)
