# # Reactive transport modeling of the H<sub>2</sub>S scavenging (with Hematite and  Pyrite)
#
# In this tutorial is dedicated to sequential reactive transport calculations of the injected
# H<sub>2</sub>S-rich brine into a siderite- and hematite-bearing reservoir with subsequent pyrite precipitation.
# All minerals are assumed to be handle by the local equilibrium.
#
# > **Note**: Similar example of H<sub>2</sub>S scavenging (with dissolving siderite and precipitating pyrrhotite)
# > can also be found in the tutorial
# > [Reactive transport modeling of the H<sub>2</sub>S scavenging process along a rock core](rt.scavenging.ipynb).
#
# ## Importing python packages
#
# First, we need to import a few Python packages to enable numerical calculations and plotting.

from reaktoro import *
import numpy as np
from tqdm.notebook import tqdm
import os

# Import components of bokeh library
from bokeh.io import show, output_notebook
from bokeh.layouts import column
from bokeh.plotting import figure
from bokeh.models import Range1d, ColumnDataSource
from bokeh.layouts import gridplot
# -

# In particular, we import the **reaktoro** package to use Reaktoro's classes and methods for performing chemical
# reaction calculations, **numpy** for working with arrays, **tqdm** for the progress bar functionality and **os**,
# to provide a portable way of using operating system dependent functionality. For plotting capabilities,
# we use **bokeh** library.
#
# ## Initializing auxiliary time-related constants
# In this step, we initialize auxiliary time-related constants from seconds up to years used in the rest of the code.

minute = 60
hour = 60 * minute
day = 24 * hour
week = 7 * day
year = 365 * day

# ## Defining parameters for the reactive transport simulation
#
# Next, we define reactive transport and numerical discretization parameters. In particular, we specify the considered
# rock domain by setting coordinates of its left and right boundaries to 0.0 m and 100.0 m, respectively. The
# discretization parameters, i.e., the number of cells and steps in time, are set to 100 and 2500, respectively.
# The reactive transport modeling procedure assumes a constant fluid velocity of 3 · 10<sup>-5</sup> m/s and
# the zero diffusion coefficient for all fluid species. The size of the time-step is set to 0.1 days (2.4 hours).
# Temperature and pressure are set to 60 &deg;C (333.15 K) and 200 atm (200 * 1.01325 * 1e5), respectively, throughout
# the tutorial. The porosity of the rock is set to 10%.

# Discretization parameters

xr = 100.0              # x-coordinate of the right boundary
ncells = 100            # number of cells in the discretization
nsteps = 1000           # number of steps in the reactive transport simulation
dx = (xr - xl) / ncells # length of the mesh cells (in units of m)
dt = 0.1*day            # time step

# Physical parameters
D = 0               # diffusion coefficient (in units of m2/s)
v = 3e-5            # fluid pore velocity (in units of m/s)
T = 60.0 + 273.15   # temperature (in units of K)
P = 200 * 1.01325 * 1e5   # pressure (in units of Pa)
phi = 0.1           # the porosity
# -

# Next, we generate the coordinates of the mesh nodes (array `xcells`) by equally dividing the interval *[xr, xl]* with
# the number of cells `ncells`. The length of the mesh-node is denoted by `dx`.

xcells = np.linspace(xl, xr, ncells + 1)  # interval [xl, xr] split into ncells

# The boolean variable `dirichlet` is set to `True` or `False`, depending on which boundary condition is considered in
# the numerical calculation. `False` corresponds to imposing the flux of the injected fluid; otherwise, `True` means
# imposing the composition of the fluid on the left boundary.

dirichlet = False  # parameter that determines whether Dirichlet BC must be used

# To make sure that the applied finite-volume scheme is stable, we need to keep track of Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy (CFL)
# number, which should be less than 1.0.

CFL = v * dt / dx
print("CFL = ", CFL)
assert CFL <= 1.0, f"Make sure that CFL = {CFL} is less that 1.0"

# ## Specifying the quantities and properties to be outputted
#
# Before running the reactive transport simulations, we specify the list of parameters to be output, i.e.,
# `pH`, molality of `H+`, `HS-`, `S2--`, `CO3--`, `HSO4-`, `H2S(aq)`, `Fe++`, as well as the concentrations
# of siderite, pyrite, and hematite.

# ## Organization of the program
#
# The main part of the tutorial consists of three parts documented in the following sections:
# * creation of folders for the results,
# * the main part of the reactive transport simulations, and
# * plotting of the obtained results.
#
# ## Creating folders for the outputted results
#
# Using **os** package, we create required folders for outputting the obtained results and for the plot and video
# files later.

folder_results = 'results-rt-scavenging-with-hematite'
def make_results_folders():
    os.system('mkdir -p ' + folder_results)

# ## Performing the reactive transport simulation
#
# The reactive transport simulation is performed below (after all the functions are defined) and consists of several
# stages:
# * initialization of the reactive transport problem and
# * performing the reactive transport simulation along with a defined time interval.
#
# The preparatory initialization step consists of the following sub-steps:
# * definition of the chemical system with its phases and species using `define_chemical_system()`,
# * definition of the initial condition of the reactive transport problem in `define_initial_condition()`,
# * definition of the boundary condition of the reactive transport problem in `define_initial_condition()`,
# * generation of auxiliary indices to partition elements using `partition_indices()` and elements' partitioning
# corresponding to fluid and solid species with function `partition_elements_in_mesh_cell()`, and, finally,
# * definition of the instance of [EquilibriumSolver](https://reaktoro.org/cpp/classReaktoro_1_1EquilibriumSolver.html).
#
# The simulation of the reactive transport problem is represented by the loop over a discretized time interval until
# the final time is reached. On each step of this loop, the following functionality of performed:
# * transport calculations using method `transport()`,
# * reactive chemical calculations with `reactive_chemistry()` function, and
# * saving the obtained results using `outputstate()`.
#
# Performing of the transport and reactive chemistry sequentially is possible due to the *operator splitting procedure*.
# First, we update the amount of elements `b` with the transport procedure. Then, `b` are used to evaluate its new
# chemical equilibrium state, producing new amounts of the species in both the fluid and solid phases (available in
# the list `states` of [ChemicalState](https://reaktoro.org/cpp/classReaktoro_1_1ChemicalState.html) objects).
# This chemical reaction equilibrium calculation step, at each mesh cell, permits aqueous species and minerals to react,
# causing mineral dissolution or precipitation, depending on how much the amount of mineral species changes.
# It can then be used, for example, to compute new porosity value for the cell.
#
# Subsections below correspond to the methods responsible for each of the functional parts listed above.
#
# ### Construction of the chemical system with its phases and species
#
# To define the chemical system, we need to initialize the class
# [Database](https://reaktoro.org/cpp/classReaktoro_1_1Database.html)
# that provides operations to retrieve physical and thermodynamic data of chemical species. To achieve that, we use
# [supcrt07.xml](https://github.com/reaktoro/reaktoro/blob/master/databases/supcrt/supcrt07.xml) database file.
#
# In addition to the database, we also need to initialize parameters in the Debye-Huckel activity model used for aqueous
# mixtures. Method `setPHREEQC` allows setting parameters *&#229;* and *b* of the ionic species according to those used
# in PHREEQC v3.
#
# Reaktoro is a general-purpose chemical solver that avoids as much as possible presuming specific assumptions about
# considered problems. Thus, one needs to specify how the chemical system of interest, which encompasses the
# specification of all phases in the system as well as the chemical species that compose each phase. Using the
# [ChemicalEditor](https://reaktoro.org/cpp/classReaktoro_1_1ChemicalEditor.html) class, one can conveniently achieve
# this, as shown below in method `define_chemical_system()`.
#
# In this step, we create an object of class [ChemicalEditor](
# https://reaktoro.org/cpp/classReaktoro_1_1ChemicalEditor.html) and specify four phases, an *aqueous* and three
# *mineral* phases that should be considered in the chemical system. The aqueous phase is defined by specifying the
# list of chemical species. Function `setChemicalModelDebyeHuckel()` helps to set the chemical model of the phase
# with the Debye-Huckel equation of state, providing specific parameters `dhModel` defined earlier. The mineral
# phases are defined as two mineral species: siderite (FeCO<sub>3</sub>), hematite (Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>),
# and pyrite (FeS<sub>2</sub>).
#
# Finally, we create an object of class [ChemicalSystem](https://reaktoro.org/cpp/classReaktoro_1_1ChemicalSystem.html)
# using the chemical system definition details stored in the object `editor`.
#

def define_chemical_system():

    # Construct the chemical system with its phases and species
    db = Database('supcrt07.xml')

    # Set PHREEQC parameters to the model
    dhModel = DebyeHuckelParams()
    dhModel.setPHREEQC()

    # Define the editor
    editor = ChemicalEditor(db)
    # Select species of the of the aqueous phase by providing the list of elements
    editor.addAqueousPhaseWithElements("C Ca Cl Fe H K Mg Na O S").\
        setChemicalModelDebyeHuckel(dhModel)
    # Select mineral phases
    editor.addMineralPhase('Pyrite')
    editor.addMineralPhase('Hematite')
    editor.addMineralPhase('Quartz')

    # Define chemical system
    system = ChemicalSystem(editor)

    return system

# ### Initial condition (IC) of the reactive transport problem
#
# We have defined and constructed the chemical system of interest, enabling us to move on to the next step in
# Reaktoro's modeling workflow: *defining our chemical reaction problems*. Below, we define its **initial condition**
# with already prescribed equilibrium conditions for *temperature*, *pressure*, and *amounts of elements* that are
# consistent to model reactive transport of injected hydrogen sulfide brine into the rock-fluid composition of siderite
# at 25 &deg;C and 1.01325 bar. The resident fluid in the rock is obtained by the mixture of the aqueous species
# summarized in the following table:
#
# | Aqueous species | Amount (kg)                          |
# |-----------------|--------------------------------------|
# | H<sub>2</sub>   | 58.0                                 |
# | Cl<sup>-</sup>  | 1122.3 · 10<sup>-3</sup>             |
# | Na<sup>+</sup>  | 624.08 · 10<sup>-3</sup>             |
# | SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> | 157.18 · 10<sup>-3</sup> |
# | Mg<sup>2+</sup> | 74.820 · 10<sup>-3</sup>             |
# | Ca<sup>2+</sup> | 23.838 · 10<sup>-3</sup>             |
# | K<sup>+</sup>   | 23.142 · 10<sup>-3</sup>             |
# | HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> | 8.236 · 10<sup>-3</sup>  |
# | O<sub>2</sub>(aq) | 58 · 10<sup>-12</sup>              |
#
# Both siderite and hematite are added in quantities of 0.5 mol to the reservoir. For equilibrating, the class
# [EquilibriumInverseProblem](https://reaktoro.org/cpp/classReaktoro_1_1EquilibriumInverseProblem.html) is used,
# where specific fixed pH and pE are be prescribed to 8.951 and 8.676, respectively.

# To calculate the system's chemical equilibrium state with the given initial conditions, we use the method
# [equilibrate](https://reaktoro.org/cpp/namespaceReaktoro.html#af2d3b39d3e0b8f9cb5a4d9bbb06b697e), the numerical
# solution of which is written in the objects `state_ic`. It is an instance of the class
# [ChemicalState](https://reaktoro.org/cpp/classReaktoro_1_1ChemicalState.html) that stores the temperature,
# pressure, and the amounts of every species in the system.
# For this calculation, Reaktoro uses an efficient **Gibbs energy minimization** computation to determine the species
# amounts that correspond to a state of minimum Gibbs energy in the system, while satisfying the prescribed amount
# conditions for temperature, pressure, and element amounts. In an inverse equilibrium problem, however, not all
# elements have known molar amounts. Their amount's constraints are replaced by other equilibrium constraints such as
# fixed pH and pE.
#
# The function ends with scaling the volume to 1 m<sup>3</sup>. Moreover, we specify the 10% porosity of the rock
# by calling `state_ic.scalePhaseVolume('Aqueous', 0.1, 'm3')`.
#
# ### Boundary condition (BC) of the reactive transport problem
#
# Next, we define the **boundary condition** of the constructed chemical system with its *temperature*, *pressure*,
# and *amounts of elements*. We prescribe the amount of injected hydrogen sulfide brine, in particular,
# 0.0196504 mol of hydrosulfide ion (HS<sup>-</sup>) and 0.167794 mol of aqueous hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S(aq)).
# None of the minerals are presented in the injected fluid. Here, the ph is lowered in comparison to the initial
# state to 5.726.
#
# After equilibration, the obtained chemical state representing the boundary condition for the injected fluid
# composition, we scale its volume to 1 m<sup>3</sup>. It is done so that the amounts of the species in the fluid are
# consistent with a mol/m<sup>3</sup> scale.

# ### Indices of partitioning fluid and solid species
#
# Only species in fluid phases are mobile and transported by advection and diffusion mechanisms. The solid phases are

# [indicesFluidSpecies](https://reaktoro.org/cpp/classReaktoro_1_1ChemicalSystem.html#ac2a8b713f46f7a66b2731ba63faa95ad)
# and

# of class [ChemicalSystem](https://reaktoro.org/cpp/classReaktoro_1_1ChemicalSystem.html) to store corresponding data
# in the lists `ifluid_species` and `isolid_species`, respectively.

    nelems = system.numElements()

    return nelems, ifluid_species, isolid_species


# ### Partitioning fluid and solid species
#
# Next, we create arrays to track the amounts of elements in the fluid and solid partition
# (i.e., the amounts of elements among all fluid phases, here only an aqueous phase, and the amounts of elements among
# all solid phases, here the mineral phases). Arrays `b`, `bfluid`, and `bsolid`  will store these concentrations
# (mol/m<sup>3</sup>) at every time step.
#
# The array `b` is initialized with the concentrations of the elements at the initial chemical state, `state_ic`,
# using method
# [elementAmounts](https://reaktoro.org/cpp/classReaktoro_1_1ChemicalState.html#a827457e68a90f89920c13f0cc06fda78)
# of class [ChemicalState](https://reaktoro.org/cpp/classReaktoro_1_1ChemicalState.html). The array `b_bc` stores
# the concentrations of each element on the boundary in mol/m<sup>3</sup><sub>fluid</sub>.

def partition_elements_in_mesh_cell(ncells, nelems, state_ic, state_bc):

    # The concentrations of each element in each mesh cell (in the current time step)
    b = np.zeros((ncells, nelems))

    # Initialize the concentrations (mol/m3) of the elements in each mesh cell

    # Initialize the concentrations (mol/m3) of each element on the boundary
    b_bc = state_bc.elementAmounts()

    return b, bfluid, bsolid, b_bc


# ### Reactive transport cycle
#
# #### Transport
#
# This step updates the fluid partition `bfluid` using the transport equations (without reactions).
# The `transport_fullimplicit()` function below is responsible for solving an advection-diffusion equation, that is
# later applied to transport the concentrations (mol/m<sup>3</sup>) of elements in the fluid partition (*a
# simplification that is possible because of common diffusion coefficients and velocities of the fluid species,
# otherwise, the transport of individual fluid species would be needed*).
#
# To match the units of concentrations of the elements in the fluid measure in mol/m<sup>3</sup><sub>bulk</sub> and the
# imposed concentration `b_bc[j]` mol/m<sup>3</sup><sub>fluid</sub>, e need to multiply it by the porosity `phi_bc`
# on the boundary cell m<sup>3</sup><sub>fluid</sub>/m<sup>3</sup><sub>bulk</sub>. We use function
# [properties](https://reaktoro.org/cpp/classReaktoro_1_1ChemicalState.html#ad3fa8fd9e1b948da7a698eb020513f3d)
# of the class [ChemicalState](https://reaktoro.org/cpp/classReaktoro_1_1ChemicalState.html) to retrieve fluid volume
# m<sup>3</sup><sub>fluid</sub> and total volume m<sup>3</sup><sub>bulk</sub> in the inflow boundary cell.
#
# The updated amounts of elements in the fluid partition are then summed with the amounts of elements in the solid
# partition `bsolid`, which remained constant during the transport step), and thus updating the amounts of elements
# in the chemical system `b`. Reactive transport calculations involve the solution of a system of
# advection-diffusion-reaction equations.

def transport(states, bfluid, bsolid, b, b_bc, nelems, ifluid_species, isolid_species):
    # Collect the amounts of elements from fluid and solid partitions

    # Update the amounts of elements in both fluid and solid partitions
    b[:] = bsolid + bfluid

    return bfluid, bsolid, b


# ##### Transport calculation with finite-volume scheme
#
# The function `transport()` expects a conservative property (argument `u`) (e.g., the concentration mol/m<sup>3</sup>
# of *j*th element in the fluid given by `bfluid[j]`), the time step (`dt`), the mesh cell length (`dx`),
# the fluid velocity (`v`), the diffusion coefficient (`D`), and the boundary condition of the conservative property
# (`g`) (e.g., the concentration of the *j*th element in the fluid on the left boundary).
#
# The transport equations are solved with a finite volume method, where diffusion and convection are treated implicitly.
# Its discretization in space and time (implicit) results in the constants `alpha` and `beta`. These correspond to
# the diffusion and advection terms in the equation: `D*dt/dx**2` and `v*dt/dx`, respectively.
#
# Arrays `a`, `b`, `c` are the diagonals in the tridiagonal matrix that results by writing all discretized equations
# in a matrix equation. This system of linear equations is solved by the tridiagonal matrix algorithm, also known
# as the Thomas algorithm.

# We see on the plots above that the main chemical reactions can be divided into three parts.
# On the first step, the iron ions Fe<sup>2+</sup> are being released by the siderite (FeCO<sub>3</sub>)
# reacting with the injected brine. On the second one, some of the free Fe<sup>2+</sup> ions are reacting
# to slightly precipitate hematite, which also tend to react with injected water and generate Fe<sup>2+</sup>. On the third
# stage, we observe all Fe<sup>2+</sup> is consumed by the forming pyrite:
# Fe<sup>2+</sup> + 2HS<sup>-</sup> &#8594; FeS<sub>2</sub> + 2H<sup>+</sup>.
#
# The minerals' dissolution and precipitation are accompanied by the formation and dilution of aqueous species.
# Both curves representing HS<sup>-</sup> and H<sub>2</sub>S(aq) have two points of the sharp decrease.
# The first and second one is where both species are involved in the dissolution of FeCO<sub>3</sub> and
# Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, whereas the second one is where they are being exhausted by the reaction
# with iron ions to form iron sulfide.
#
# To study the time-dependent behavior of the chemical properties, we create a Bokeh application using the function
# `modify_doc(doc)`. It creates Bokeh content and adds it to the app. The speed of streaming of reactive transport
# data can be  controlled by the parameter `step` defined below (bigger the step, faster we will run through available
