# # Inverse chemical equilibrium calculations
#
# This tutorial demonstrates how to use Reaktoro to perform *inverse chemical
# equilibrium calculations*.
#
# In an inverse chemical equilibrium problem, not all elements have known
# amounts. Instead of fully specifying their amounts, we impose one or more
# equilibrium constraints such as fixed species amount, fixed species activity,
# fixed volume of a phase, fixed pH of an aqueous solution; the possibilities
# are many.
#
# Since the amounts of elements are not known a priori, an inverse equilibrium
# calculation tries to determine amounts of titrants that can control the
# specified equilibrium constraints. The amounts of the titrants are unknown,
# and its addition or removal is done over the calculation so that the
# equilibrium state is driven towards a state where all given equilibrium
# constraints are satisfied.
#
# Below we create a chemical system containing an aqueous phase, a gaseous
# phase, and a mineral phase.

# #### Equilibrium problem with fixed pH, species amount, and species activity
#
# In this problem, we fix the pH of the aqueous solution to 3, and specify that
# HCl is the titrant that should be added or removed so that this constraint is
# satisfied. Therefore, the amounts of H and Cl are not known in advance.
#
# To obtain an aqueous solution saturated with CO<sub>2</sub>, we also add a
# constraint that enforces 1 mol for the amount of gaseous species
# CO<sub>2</sub>(g) at equilibrium.
#
# Finally, we add an activity constraint for gaseous species O<sub>2</sub>(g).
# This is equivalent to enforcing the fugacity of the gas.

# #### Equilibrium problem with fixed pH controlled by CO<sub>2</sub>
#
# The second equilibrium inverse problem has similar conditions to those used
# for the first problem. However, in this case, we fix pH to be equal to 4.0,
# with CO<sub>2</sub> being the titrant whose amount to be added into the system
# is unknown in advance.

# #### Equilibrium problem with fixed pH controlled by either HCl or NaOH
#
# In this equilibrium problem, we also fix the pH of the aqueous solution, but we
# specify that this constraint is to be satisfied by titrating either HCl or
# NaOH (not both!).
