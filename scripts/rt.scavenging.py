# # Reactive transport modeling of the H<sub>2</sub>S scavenging process along a rock core
#
# In this tutorial, we show how Reaktoro can be used for sequential reactive transport calculations of the injected
# H<sub>2</sub>S-rich brine into the siderite bearing reservoir with subsequent pyrrhotite, or otherwise called
# mackinawite, (FeS) precipitation.
#
# ## Importing python packages
#
# First, we need to import a few Python packages to enable the numerical calculations and plotting.

# +
from reaktoro import *
import numpy as np
from natsort import natsorted
from tqdm.notebook import tqdm
import os

# Import components of bokeh library
from bokeh.io import show, output_notebook
from bokeh.layouts import column
from bokeh.plotting import figure
from bokeh.models import Range1d, ColumnDataSource
from bokeh.layouts import gridplot
# -

# We import the **reaktoro** Python package so that we can use its classes and methods for performing chemical
# reaction calculations, **numpy** for working with arrays, **tqdm** for the progress bar functionality and **os**,
# to provide a portable way of using operating system dependent functionality. For plotting capabilities of obtained
# results, we use **bokeh** library.
#
# ## Initializing auxiliary time-related constants
#
# In this step, we initialize auxiliary time-related constants from seconds up to days used in the rest of the code.

second = 1
minute = 60
hour = 60 * minute
day = 24 * hour

# ## Defining parameters for the reactive transport simulation
#
# Next, we define reactive transport and numerical discretization parameters. In particular, we specify the considered
# rock domain by setting coordinates of its left and right boundaries to 0.0 m and 100.0 m, respectively. The
# discretization parameters, i.e., the number of cells and steps in time, are set to 100 and 1000, respectively.
# The reactive transport modeling procedure assumes a constant fluid velocity of 1.05 · 10<sup>-5</sup> m/s and
# the zero diffusion coefficient for all fluid species. The size of the time-step is set to 0.05 days (1.2 hours).
# Temperature and pressure are set to 25 &deg;C and 1 atm (1.01325 bar), respectively, throughout the tutorial.
# The porosity fo the rock is set to 10%.

# +
# Discretization parameters
xl = 0.0                # x-coordinate of the left boundary
xr = 100.0              # x-coordinate of the right boundary
ncells = 100            # number of cells in the discretization
nsteps = 1000           # number of steps in the reactive transport simulation
dx = (xr - xl) / ncells # length of the mesh cells (in units of m)
dt = 0.05*day           # time step

# Physical parameters
D = 0               # diffusion coefficient (in units of m2/s)
v = 1.05e-5         # fluid pore velocity (in units of m/s)
T = 25.0 + 273.15   # temperature (in units of K)
P = 1.01325 * 1e5   # pressure (in units of Pa)
phi = 0.1           # the porosity
# -

# Next, we generate the coordinates of the mesh nodes (array `xcells`) by equally dividing the interval *[xr, xl]* with
# the number of cells `ncells`. The length between each consecutive mesh node is computed and stored in `dx` (the
# length of the mesh cells).

xcells = np.linspace(xl, xr, ncells + 1)  # interval [xl, xr] split into ncells

# The boolean variable `dirichlet` is set to `True` or `False` depending on which boundary condition is considered in
# the numerical calculation. `False` corresponds to imposing the flux of the injected fluid; otherwise, `True` means
# imposing the fluid composition on the left boundary.

dirichlet = False  # parameter that determines whether Dirichlet BC must be used

# To make sure that the applied finite-volume scheme is stable, we need to keep track of Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy (CFL)
# number, which should be less than 1.0.

CFL = v * dt / dx
assert CFL <= 1.0, f"Make sure that CFL = {CFL} is less that 1.0"

# ## Specifying the quantities and properties to be outputted
#
# Before running the reactive transport simulations, we create the list of parameters we are interested in outputting.
# In this case, it is `pH`, molality of `H+`, `HS-`, `S2--`, `CO3--`, `HSO4-`, `H2S(aq)`, `Fe++`, as well as a phase
# amount/volume of minerals pyrrhotite and siderite.

output_quantities = """
    pH
    speciesMolality(H+)
    speciesMolality(HS-)
    speciesMolality(S2--)
    speciesMolality(CO3--)

    phaseAmount(Pyrrhotite)
    phaseAmount(Siderite)
    phaseVolume(Pyrrhotite)
    phaseVolume(Siderite)

# Then, we define the list of names for the DataFrame columns. Note, that they must correspond
# to the order of the properties defined in the `output_quantities` list:

column_quantities = """

    HSanion

# Create the list of columns and initialized with it the instance of dataframe:

columns = ['step', 'x'] + column_quantities
import pandas as pd
df = pd.DataFrame(columns=columns)

# ## Organization of the program
#
# The main part of the program (at the bottom of this tutorial) consists of three parts, each represented by a Python
# function and documented in the following sections:
# * creation of folders for the results (function `make_results_folders()`),
# * simulation of reactive transport problem (method `simulate()`), and
# * plotting of the obtained results.
#
# ## Creating folders for the outputted results
#
# Using **os** package, we create required folders for outputting the obtained results and for the plot and video
# files later.

folder_results = 'results-rt-scavenging'
def make_results_folders():
    os.system('mkdir -p ' + folder_results)

# ## Performing the reactive transport simulation
#
# The reactive transport simulation is performed in the function `simulate`, which consists of several building blocks
# (functions):
# * initialization of the reactive transport problem and
# * performing the reactive transport simulation along with a defined time interval.
#
# The preparatory initialization step consists of the following sub-steps:
# * definition of the chemical system with its phases and species using `define_chemical_system()`,
# * definition of the initial condition of the reactive transport problem in `define_initial_condition()`,
# * definition of the boundary condition of the reactive transport problem in `define_initial_condition()`,
# * generation of auxiliary indices to partition elements using `partition_indices()` and elements' partitioning
# corresponding to fluid and solid species with function `partition_elements_in_mesh_cell()`, and finally
# * definition of instance of [EquilibriumSolver](https://reaktoro.org/cpp/classReaktoro_1_1EquilibriumSolver.html).
#
# The simulation of the reactive transport problem is represented by the loop over discretized time interval until
# the final time is reached. On each step of this loop, the following functionality of performed:
# * transport calculations using method `transport()`,
# * reactive chemical calculations with `reactive_chemistry()` function, and
# * saving the obtained results using `outputstate()`.
#
# Performing the transport and reactive chemistry sequentially is possible due to the *operator splitting
# procedure*, in which we first update the amounts of elements `b`. These updated amounts of
# elements in the cell are used to evaluate its new chemical equilibrium state, thus producing new amounts of the
# species in both the fluid and solid phases (available in the list `states` of
# [ChemicalState](https://reaktoro.org/cpp/classReaktoro_1_1ChemicalState.html) objects). This chemical reaction
# equilibrium calculation step, at each mesh cell, permits, for example, aqueous species and minerals to react,
# and thus causes mineral dissolution or precipitation, depending on how much the amount of mineral species changes.
# This can then be used, for example, to compute new porosity value for the cell.

def simulate():
    # Construct the chemical system with its phases and species
    system = define_chemical_system()

    # Define the initial condition of the reactive transport modeling problem
    state_ic = define_initial_condition(system)

    # Define the boundary condition of the reactive transport modeling problem

    # Create a list of chemical states for the mesh cells (one for each cell, initialized to state_ic)
    states = [state_ic.clone() for _ in range(ncells + 1)]

    # Create the equilibrium solver object for the repeated equilibrium calculation
    solver = EquilibriumSolver(system)

    # Running the reactive transport simulation loop
    step = 0  # the current step number
    t = 0.0  # the current time (in seconds)

# Subsections below correspond to the methods responsible for each of the functional parts of `simulate()` method.
#
# ### Construction of the chemical system with its phases and species
#
# To define the chemical system, we need to initialize the class
# [Database](https://reaktoro.org/cpp/classReaktoro_1_1Database.html)
# that provides operations to retrieve physical and thermodynamic data of chemical species. To achieve that, we use
# [supcrt07.xml](https://github.com/reaktoro/reaktoro/blob/master/databases/supcrt/supcrt07.xml) database file.
#
# **Note:** If filename does not point to a valid database file or the database file is not found, then a default
# built-in database with the same name will be tried. If no default built-in database exists with a given name,
# an exception will be thrown.
#
# In addition to the database, we also need to initialize parameters in the Debye-Huckel activity model used for aqueous
# mixtures. Method `setPHREEQC` allows setting parameters *&#229;* and *b* of the ionic species according to those used
# in PHREEQC v3.
#
# Reaktoro is a general-purpose chemical solver that avoids as much as possible presuming specific assumptions about
# considered problems. Thus, one needs to specify how the chemical system of interest encompasses all phases
# as well as the chemical species in each phase. Using the
# [ChemicalEditor](https://reaktoro.org/cpp/classReaktoro_1_1ChemicalEditor.html) class, one can conveniently achieve
# this, as shown below in method `define_chemical_system()`.
#
# In this step, we create an object of class [ChemicalEditor](
# https://reaktoro.org/cpp/classReaktoro_1_1ChemicalEditor.html) and specify three phases, an *aqueous* and a
# *mineral* that should be considered in the chemical system. The aqueous phase is defined by specifying the list of
# chemical species. Function `setChemicalModelDebyeHuckel()` helps to set the chemical model of the phase with
# the Debye-Huckel equation of state, providing specific parameters `dhModel` defined earlier. The mineral phases
# are defined as two mineral species: pyrrhotite (FeS) and siderite (FeCO<sub>3</sub>).
#
# Finally, we create an object of class [ChemicalSystem](https://reaktoro.org/cpp/classReaktoro_1_1ChemicalSystem.html)
# using the chemical system definition details stored in the object `editor`.
#
# The *activity coefficients* of the aqueous species in this tutorial are calculated using the *Debye-Huckel model*
# for solvent water and ionic species. The *standard chemical potentials* of the species are calculated using the
# equations of state of Helgeson and Kirkham (1974), Helgeson et al. (1974), Tanger and Helgeson (1988),
# Shock and Helgeson (1988), and Shock et al. ( 1992). The database file [slop07.dat](
# https://github.com/reaktoro/reaktoro/blob/master/databases/supcrt/slop07.dat) from the software SUPCRT07 is used to
# obtain the parameters for the equations of state. The equation of state of Wagner and Pruss (2002) is used to
# calculate the *density of water* and its temperature and pressure derivatives. Kinetics of *dissolution* and
# *precipitation* of both pyrrhotite and siderite is neglected, i.e., the local equilibrium assumption is employed.

def define_chemical_system():

# ### Initial condition (IC) of the reactive transport problem
#
# We have defined and constructed the chemical system of interest, enabling us to move on to the next step in
# Reaktoro's modeling workflow: *defining our chemical reaction problems*. Below, we define its **initial condition**
# with already prescribed equilibrium conditions for *temperature*, *pressure*, and *amounts of elements* consistent
# with modeling reactive transport of injected hydrogen sulfide brine into the rock-fluid composition of siderite
# at 25 &deg;C and 1.01325 bar. The resident fluid in the rock is obtained by the mixture of the aqueous species
# summarized in the following table:
#
# | Aqueous species | Amount (kg)                          |
# |-----------------|--------------------------------------|
# | H<sub>2</sub>  | 58.0                                 |
# | Cl<sup>-</sup> | 1122.3 · 10<sup>-3</sup>             |
# | Na<sup>+</sup> | 624.08 · 10<sup>-3</sup>             |
# | SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> | 157.18 · 10<sup>-3</sup>|
# | Mg<sup>2+</sup> | 74.820 · 10<sup>-3</sup>            |
# | Ca<sup>2+</sup> | 23.838 · 10<sup>-3</sup>            |
# | K<sup>+</sup> | 23.142 · 10<sup>-3</sup>              |
# | HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> | 8.236 · 10<sup>-3</sup> |
# | O<sub>2</sub>(aq) | 58 · 10<sup>-12</sup>              |
#
# For that purpose, the class
# [EquilibriumInverseProblem](https://reaktoro.org/cpp/classReaktoro_1_1EquilibriumInverseProblem.html) is used, where
# specific fixed pH and pE are be prescribed to 8.951 and 8.676, respectively.

# > **Note**: After providing the amounts of substances H<sub>2</sub>O, aqueous species, pyrrhotite, and siderite in
# > the above code, Reaktoro parses these chemical formulas (using the thermodynamic database) and determines the
# > elements and their coefficients. Once this is done, the amount of each element stored inside the object
# > `problem_ic` is incremented according to the given amount of substance and its coefficient in the formula. The
# > provided element amounts are then used as constraints for the Gibbs energy minimization calculation when
# > computing the state of chemical equilibrium (i.e., when we try to find the amounts of all species in the system
# > that corresponds to a state of minimum Gibbs energy while satisfying the *element amounts
# > constraints*).
#
# > **Note**: Please note that we are not condemning the input form shown above in terms of element amounts,
# > but only telling you to be attentive with the values you input. If you are using Reaktoro as a chemical reaction
# > solver in a reactive transport simulator, for example, you will most likely need to work directly with given amounts
# > of elements, which shows that this input form is required in certain cases. For such time-dependent modeling
# > problems, you often only need to ensure that the initial conditions for elements amounts result in feasible initial
# > species amounts.
#
# To calculate the system's chemical equilibrium state with the given initial conditions, we use the method
# [equilibrate](https://reaktoro.org/cpp/namespaceReaktoro.html#af2d3b39d3e0b8f9cb5a4d9bbb06b697e), the numerical
# solution of which is written in the objects `state_ic`. It is an instance of the class
# [ChemicalState](https://reaktoro.org/cpp/classReaktoro_1_1ChemicalState.html) that stores the temperature,
# pressure, and the amounts of every species in the system.
# For this calculation, Reaktoro uses an efficient **Gibbs energy minimization** computation to determine the species
# amounts that correspond to a state of minimum Gibbs energy in the system, while satisfying the prescribed amount
# conditions for temperature, pressure, and element amounts. In an inverse equilibrium problem, however, not all
# elements have known molar amounts. Their amount's constraints are replaced by other equilibrium constraints such as
# fixed pH and pE.
#
# > *See tutorials [**EquilibriumInverseProblem**](eq.inverse-equilibrium.ipynb) for more detailed explanation of
# > capabilities of this class*.
#
# The function ends with scaling the volume to 1 m<sup>3</sup>. Moreover, we specify the 10% porosity of the rock
# by calling `state_ic.scalePhaseVolume('Aqueous', 0.1, 'm3')`.
#
#
# ### Boundary condition (BC) of the reactive transport problem
#
# Next, we define the **boundary condition** of the constructed chemical system with its *temperature*, *pressure*,
# and *amounts of elements*. We prescribe the amount of injected hydrogen sulfide brine, in particular,
# 0.0196504 mol of hydrosulfide ion (HS<sup>-</sup>) and 0.167794 mol of aqueous hydrogen sulfide (H2S(aq)).
# Here, the ph is lowered in comparison to the initial state to 5.726.
#
# After equilibration, the obtained chemical state representing the boundary condition for the injected fluid
# composition, we scale its volume to 1 m<sup>3</sup>. This is done so that the amounts of the species in the fluid are
# consistent with a mol/m<sup>3</sup> scale.

def define_boundary_condition(system):

    # Define the boundary condition of the reactive transport modeling problem

# ### Indices of partitioning fluid and solid species
#
# Only species in fluid phases are mobile and transported by advection and diffusion mechanisms. The solid phases are
# immobile. The code below identifies the indices of the fluid and solid species. We use methods
# [indicesFluidSpecies](https://reaktoro.org/cpp/classReaktoro_1_1ChemicalSystem.html#ac2a8b713f46f7a66b2731ba63faa95ad)
# and

# of class [ChemicalSystem](https://reaktoro.org/cpp/classReaktoro_1_1ChemicalSystem.html) to get the indices of the
# fluid and solid species stored in the lists `ifluid_species` and `isolid_species`, respectively.

    return nelems, ifluid_species, isolid_species


# ### Partitioning fluid and solid species
#
# In this function, we create arrays to track the amounts of elements in the fluid and solid partition
# (i.e., the amounts of elements among all fluid phases, here only an aqueous phase, and the amounts of elements among
# all solid phases, here the mineral phases). The arrays `b`, `bfluid`, and `bsolid` will store, respectively,
# the concentrations (mol/m<sup>3</sup>) of each element in the system, in the fluid
# partition, and in the solid partition at every time step.
#
# The array `b` is initialized with the concentrations of the elements at the initial chemical state, `state_ic`,
# using method
# [elementAmounts](https://reaktoro.org/cpp/classReaktoro_1_1ChemicalState.html#a827457e68a90f89920c13f0cc06fda78)
# of class [ChemicalState](https://reaktoro.org/cpp/classReaktoro_1_1ChemicalState.html). The array `b_bc` stores
# the concentrations of each element on the boundary in mol/m<sup>3</sup><sub>fluid</sub>.

def partition_elements_in_mesh_cell(ncells, nelems, state_ic, state_bc):
    # The concentrations of each element in each mesh cell (in the current time step)
    b = np.zeros((ncells, nelems))
    # Initialize the concentrations (mol/m3) of the elements in each mesh cell
    b[:] = state_ic.elementAmounts()

    # The concentrations (mol/m3) of each element in the fluid partition, in each mesh cell
    bfluid = np.zeros((ncells, nelems))

    # The concentrations (mol/m3) of each element in the solid partition, in each mesh cell
    bsolid = np.zeros((ncells, nelems))

    # Initialize the concentrations (mol/m3) of each element on the boundary

    return b, bfluid, bsolid, b_bc


# ### Reactive transport cycle
#
# #### Transport
#
# This step updates in the fluid partition `bfluid` using the transport equations (without reactions).
# The `transport_full_implicit()` function below is responsible for solving an advection-diffusion equation, that is
# later applied to transport the concentrations (mol/m<sup>3</sup>) of elements in the fluid partition (*a
# simplification that is possible because of common diffusion coefficients and velocities of the fluid species,
# otherwise the transport of individual fluid species would be needed*).

# To match the units of concentrations of the elements in the fluid measure in mol/m<sup>3</sup><sub>bulk</sub> and the

# of the class [ChemicalState](https://reaktoro.org/cpp/classReaktoro_1_1ChemicalState.html) to retrieve fluid volume

# The updated amounts of elements in the fluid partition are then summed with the amounts of elements in the solid
# partition `bsolid`, which remained constant during the transport step), and thus updating the amounts of elements
# in the chemical system `b`. Reactive transport calculations involve the solution of a system of
# advection-diffusion-reaction equations.

# ##### Transport calculation with finite-volume scheme
#
# The function `transport()` expects a conservative property (argument `u`) (e.g., the concentration mol/m<sup>3</sup>
# of *j*th element in the fluid given by `bfluid[j]`), the time step (`dt`), the mesh cell length (`dx`),
# the fluid velocity (`v`), the diffusion coefficient (`D`), and the boundary condition of the conservative property
# (`g`) (e.g., the concentration of the *j*th element in the fluid on the left boundary).
#
# The transport equations are solved with a finite volume method, where diffusion and convection are treated implicitly.
# Its discretization in space and time (implicit) results in the constants `alpha` and `beta`. These correspond to
# the diffusion and advection terms in the equation: `D*dt/dx**2` and `v*dt/dx`, respectively.
#
# Arrays `a`, `b`, `c` are the diagonals in the tridiagonal matrix that results by writing all discretized equations
# in a matrix equation. This system of linear equations is solved by the tridiagonal matrix algorithm, also known
# as the Thomas algorithm.

def transport_full_implicit(u, dt, dx, v, D, ul):
    # Number of DOFs
    n = len(u)
    alpha = D * dt / dx ** 2
    beta = v * dt / dx

    a = np.full(n, -beta - alpha)
    b = np.full(n, 1 + beta + 2 * alpha)
    c = np.full(n, -alpha)

    if dirichlet:
        # Use Dirichlet BC boundary conditions
        b[0] = 1.0
        c[0] = 0.0

# To inspect the collected data, one can run:

df

# To save the results in csv-format, please execute:

df.to_csv(folder_results + '/rt.scavenging.csv', index=False)

# Select the steps, on which results must plotted:

# Outputting the plots to the notebook requires the call of `output_notebook()` that specifies outputting the plot
# inline in the Jupyter notebook:

# Plot ph on the selected steps:

plot_figures_ph(selected_steps_to_plot)

# Plot pyrrhotite and siderite phase amounts on the selected steps:

plot_figures_pyrrhotite_siderite_amount(selected_steps_to_plot)

# One can also call `plot_figures_pyrrhotite_siderite_volume(selected_steps_to_plot)` instead of the function
# `plot_figures_pyrrhotite_siderite_amount()`.

# Plot aqueous species on the selected steps:

plot_figures_aqueous_species(selected_steps_to_plot)

# We see on the plots above that the main chemical reactions can be divided into two parts.
# On the first step, the iron ions Fe<sup>2+</sup> are being released by the siderite (FeCO<sub>3</sub>) reacting with
# the H<sub>2</sub>S-brine. On the second one, free Fe<sup>2+</sup> ions are reacting with hydrogen sulfide
# precipitating iron sulfide (pyrrhotite): Fe<sup>2+</sup> + H<sub>2</sub>S &#8594; FeS<sub>2</sub>.
#
# The minerals' dissolution and precipitation are accompanied by the formation and dilution of aqueous species.
# For instance, we see the sharp increase of Fe<sup>2+</sup> at the point of the phase transformation from the siderite
# phase to pyrrhotite and followed by the gradual decrease as it gets used during the formation of FeS<sub>2</sub>.
# Both curves representing HS<sup>-</sup> and H<sub>2</sub>S(aq) have two points of the sharp decrease.
# The first one is where both species are involved in the dissolution of FeCO<sub>3</sub>, and the second one is where
# they are being exhausted by the reaction with iron ions to form iron sulfide. The CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> anion
# line has an interesting shape: it first locally drops but then increases due to continuous dissolution of siderite.
#
# To study the time-dependent behavior of the chemical properties, we create a Bokeh application using the function
# `modify_doc(doc)`. It creates Bokeh content and adds it to the app. The speed of streaming of reactive transport
# data can be controlled by the parameter `step` defined below (bigger the step, faster we will run through available
