# # Functionality of ChemicalEditor class
#
# In this tutorial, we provide clarification of the functionality of the class
# [ChemicalEditor](https://reaktoro.org/cpp/classReaktoro_1_1ChemicalEditor.html) that is used to
# conveniently create chemical and reaction systems.
#
# ### Importing the reaktoro Python package
#
# Using **Reaktoro** in Python requires an import of the python package `reaktoro`:

from reaktoro import *

# The default thermodynamic databases embedded into Reaktoro is SUPCRT92, so you do not have to initialize the
# database `db = Database('supcrt98.xml')`, unless an alternative database must be used.
#
# ### Initializing chemical editor
#
# Class [ChemicalEditor](https://reaktoro.org/cpp/classReaktoro_1_1ChemicalEditor.html)
# provides convenient operations to initialize
# [ChemicalSystem](https://reaktoro.org/cpp/classReaktoro_1_1ChemicalSystem.html) and
# [ReactionSystem](https://reaktoro.org/cpp/classReaktoro_1_1ReactionSystem.html) instances.
# To define the editor of the chemical system from the default database SUPCRT92, we use:

editor = ChemicalEditor()

# Alternatively, the editor can be initialized by the database instance:

# Initialize a thermodynamic database with supcrt98.xml
db = Database("supcrt98.xml")
# Define the editor of the chemical system
editor = ChemicalEditor(db)

# ### Preparation of chemical system definition
#
# Before the definition of chemical system, aqueous, gaseous, and mineral phases must be added. It can be done in
# various ways. Let us consider, first, the definition of aqueous species:
#
# * With method [ChemicalEditor::addAqueousPhase](
# https://reaktoro.org/cpp/classReaktoro_1_1ChemicalEditor.html#a68cdc98877671b61490d0752b3060d91),
# the [AqueousPhase](https://reaktoro.org/cpp/classReaktoro_1_1AqueousPhase.html)
# can be created by specifying the names of the species one by
# one. These species names must conform to those used in the database that was specified during the initialization of
# the [ChemicalEditor](https://reaktoro.org/cpp/classReaktoro_1_1ChemicalEditor.html) object, otherwise, an exception
# will be thrown.

editor.addAqueousPhase(
    ["H2O(l)", "H+", "OH-", "Na+", "Cl-", "HCO3-", "CO3--", "CO2(aq)"]
)

# * Alternatively, instead of listing the names of the species one by one, which might require prior knowledge of the
# species names in the database, we can use method [ChemicalEditor::addAqueousPhaseWithElements](
# https://reaktoro.org/cpp/classReaktoro_1_1ChemicalEditor.html#a2c11397b4d486cf0fc18ae26eaf87980).
# It permits the [AqueousPhase](https://reaktoro.org/cpp/classReaktoro_1_1AqueousPhase.html)
# object to be constructed by using a list of chemical element names. The database will be searched for all
# species that could be formed out of those elements. These species will then be used to construct
# [AqueousPhase](https://reaktoro.org/cpp/classReaktoro_1_1AqueousPhase.html) object.

editor.addAqueousPhaseWithElements("H O C Ca Cl Mg")

# * Finally, [AqueousPhase](https://reaktoro.org/cpp/classReaktoro_1_1AqueousPhase.html)
# object can be also constructed by using a list of compounds or substance names that might not
# necessarily represent names of species in the database. The list of compounds will be broken into a list of element
# names, and the database will be similarly searched for all species that could be formed out of those elements.

editor.addAqueousPhaseWithElementsOf("H2O NaCl CO2")

# > **Note:** The call of
# [ChemicalEditor::addAqueousPhaseWithElements](https://reaktoro.org/cpp/classReaktoro_1_1ChemicalEditor.html#a2c11397b4d486cf0fc18ae26eaf87980) will result in larger chemical system than
# > call of [ChemicalEditor::addAqueousPhase](https://reaktoro.org/cpp/classReaktoro_1_1ChemicalEditor.html#a68cdc98877671b61490d0752b3060d91), where the specific aqueous species are provided.  In more demanding
# > applications (e.g., as a chemical solver in a reactive transport simulator), you might want to manually specify the
# > chemical species of each phase in your chemical system.

# To add gaseous phase, similar methods can be used:

editor.addGaseousPhase(["H2O(g)", "CO2(g)", "H2(g)", "O2(g)", "CH4(g)"])
editor.addGaseousPhaseWithElements(["H", "O", "C"])
editor.addGaseousPhaseWithElementsOf(["H2O", "CO2"])

# The [MineralPhase](https://reaktoro.org/cpp/classReaktoro_1_1MineralPhase.html) object is created by specifying the
# names of the species one by one. These species names must
# conform to those used in the database that was specified during the initialization of the
# [ChemicalEditor](https://reaktoro.org/cpp/classReaktoro_1_1ChemicalEditor.html) object,
# otherwise, an exception will be thrown. The example below describes the usage of this method for the creation of two
# pure mineral phases and one solid solution with two mineral species.

editor.addMineralPhase("Calcite")
editor.addMineralPhase("Dolomite")
editor.addMineralPhase(["Dolomite", "Calcite"])

# There are two more alternatives to add [MinerialPhase](https://reaktoro.org/cpp/classReaktoro_1_1MineralPhase.html),
# i.e.,

editor.addMineralPhaseWithElements(["Ca", "C", "O"])
editor.addMineralPhaseWithElementsOf(["CaCO3", "MgCO3"])

# Besides phases, one could also set temperatures and pressures of considered chemical system for constructing
# interpolation tables of thermodynamic properties., e.g.,

editor.setTemperatures([60, 80, 100, 120, 140, 160], "celsius")
editor.setPressures([1, 10, 100], "bar")

# Finally, the definition of the chemical system is done by calling

system = ChemicalSystem(editor)
